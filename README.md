# CD Pipeline Operator

Get acquainted with the CD Pipeline Operator and the installation process as well as the local development, 
and architecture scheme.

## Overview

CD Pipeline Operator is an EDP operator that is responsible for provisioning continuous delivery pipeline entities. 
Operator installation can be applied on two container orchestration platforms: OpenShift and Kubernetes.

_**NOTE:** Operator is platform-independent, that is why there is a unified instruction for deploying._

## Prerequisites
1. Linux machine or Windows Subsystem for Linux instance with [Helm 3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed;
2. Cluster admin access to the cluster;
3. EDP project/namespace is deployed by following one of the instructions: [edp-install-openshift](https://github.com/epmd-edp/edp-install/blob/master/documentation/openshift_install_edp.md#edp-project) or [edp-install-kubernetes](https://github.com/epmd-edp/edp-install/blob/master/documentation/kubernetes_install_edp.md#edp-namespace).

## Installation
In order to install the CD Pipeline Operator, follow the steps below:

1. To add the Helm EPAMEDP Charts for local client, run "helm repo add":
     ```bash
     helm repo add epamedp https://chartmuseum.demo.edp-epam.com/
     ```
2. Choose available Helm chart version:
     ```bash
     helm search repo epamedp/cd-pipeline-operator
     NAME                              CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
     epamedp/cd-pipeline-operator      v2.4.0                          Helm chart for Golang application/service deplo...
     ```
   _**NOTE:** It is highly recommended to use the latest released version._
   
3. Deploy operator:   

    Full available chart parameters list:
    ```
    - chart_version                                 # a version of CD Pipeline operator Helm chart;
    - global.edpName                                # a namespace or a project name (in case of OpenShift);
    - global.platform                               # openshift or kubernetes;
    - image.name                                    # EDP image. The released image can be found on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/epamedp/cd-pipeline-operator);
    - image.version                                 # EDP tag. The released image can be found on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/epamedp/cd-pipeline-operator/tags);
    ```

4. Install operator in the <edp_cicd_project> namespace with the helm command; find below the installation command example:

    ```bash
    helm install cd-pipeline-operator epamedp/cd-pipeline-operator --version <chart_version> --namespace <edp_cicd_project> --set name=cd-pipeline-operator --set global.edpName=<edp_cicd_project> --set global.platform=<platform_type>
    ```

5. Check the <edp_cicd_project> namespace that should contain operator deployment with your operator in a running status.

## Local Development
In order to develop the operator, first set up a local environment. For details, please refer to the [Local Development](documentation/local-development.md) page.
